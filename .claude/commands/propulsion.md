# Epstein Drive

The Epstein drive is a revolutionary fusion-based rocket engine from The Expanse that enables rapid interplanetary travel by allowing ships to continuously accelerate at high 'g' forces for extended periods. Invented by Dr. Solomon Epstein, the drive uses magnetic coils to accelerate plasma exhaust from a fusion reaction, allowing spacecraft to reach speeds near the speed of light. This allows for travel between Earth and Mars in just a few days, significantly shortening voyages to the outer solar system.

## Classification
Theoretical propulsion method from The Expanse book series.

## How it works
Fusion power: The drive generates power through nuclear fusion, creating immense heat and plasma.

* Magnetic acceleration: Instead of a traditional nozzle, it uses magnetic coils to contain and accelerate the plasma exhaust to extremely high velocities, which are a fraction of the speed of light.

* it should contantly accelerate at 1.5G until it needs to flip and burn at 1.5G, for safe transport of living beings.

* Constant acceleration: The drive's primary feature is its ability to maintain constant thrust, allowing ships to accelerate to high speeds for the first half of their journey and then flip to decelerate for the second half.

* Efficiency: The technology is highly efficient, allowing for sustained acceleration that would be impossible with older propulsion systems.

This drive requires a flip and burn half way to the destination.
